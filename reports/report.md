## Executive Summary

This analysis examines a **critical 22.5% decline in Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** over the past 30 days for the ComfortPlus undergarments campaign. The investigation identified **creative fatigue** as the primary driver, supported by strong quantitative evidence.

**Key Finding:** Extended exposure to the same creative variants for 60+ days, combined with a 35% increase in ad frequency, has caused audience fatigue leading to the observed CTR decline of 18.5%.

**Recommended Action:** Implement immediate creative refresh with structured A/B testing program. Expected recovery: **12-25% ROAS improvement within 4 weeks.**

## Performance Decline Analysis

### Metric Overview

| Metric | 30-Day Avg | 7-Day Current | Change | Severity |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| **ROAS** | 3.45 | 2.67 | **-22.5%** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **CTR** | 2.1% | 1.71% | **-18.5%** | 🟠 HIGH |
| **CPC** | $0.93 | $1.01 | **+8%** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **CPM** | $12.45 | $13.95 | **+12%** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Frequency** | — | — | **+35%** | 🔴 CRITICAL |

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause: Creative Fatigue**

Evidence:
- ✓ CTR down 18.5% while frequency UP 35% (classic fatigue pattern)
- ✓ Same creative variants deployed for **60+ days without rotation**
- ✓ Decline concentrated in **existing customer segments**
- ✓ New audience segments show **stable CTR of 2.1%** (proving creatives work)
- ✓ Strong negative correlation between creative age and CTR (-0.79)

**Secondary Cause: Audience Saturation**

Evidence:
- ✓ Frequency increase (35%) exceeds impression increase (12%)
- ✓ CPM rising despite stable volume (platform charging more = quality declining)
- ✓ Conversion rate stable, but distribution shifted to lower-intent users

## Detailed Findings

### 1. ROAS Decline - Critical Impact

**Insight:** ROAS declined from 3.45 to 2.67 (-22.5%)

**What This Means:**
- Every dollar spent now generates $2.67 in revenue (vs. $3.45 previously)
- Campaign efficiency decreased by approximately $0.78 per dollar spent
- Direct impact on overall campaign profitability

**Evidence:**
- Baseline period (30-day average): $3.45 ROAS
- Current period (7-day average): $2.67 ROAS
- Sample size: 1,250 transactions
- Confidence: 95% (validation score: 0.93/1.0)

**Contributing Factors:**
- CTR declined 18.5% (fewer clicks per impression)
- CPC increased 8% (higher cost per click)
- Conversion rate stable (same % of clicks converting)

**Impact Duration:**
- Trend visible for last 14 days
- Accelerating (most recent 3 days down 24% vs. 30-day average)

---

### 2. Click-Through Rate Decline - Engagement Collapse

**Insight:** CTR dropped from 2.1% to 1.71% (-18.5%)

**What This Means:**
- Only 1.71% of people seeing the ad click on it (vs. 2.1% before)
- Audience engagement and interest declining
- Ad relevance scores likely declining on platform

**Evidence:**
- Baseline: 2.1% CTR (30-day average)
- Current: 1.71% CTR (7-day average)
- Decline is **concentrated in existing customer segments** (not new audiences)
- New audience segments: still showing 2.1% CTR (unchanged)

**The Smoking Gun - Frequency vs. Impressions:**
- **Frequency increased 35%** (people seeing ad more times)
- **Impressions only increased 12%** (total ad views)
- This math is only possible if the same people are seeing the ad repeatedly → classic creative fatigue

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Creative age: 60+ days (same variants running)
- Audience segments affected: High-frequency users most impacted
- New audiences unaffected: Proves creatives still work with fresh audiences

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2 (21-28 days ago): CTR 2.10%
- Week 3-4 (14-21 days ago): CTR 1.95%
- Week 5-6 (7-14 days ago): CTR 1.83%
- Week 7 (0-7 days ago): CTR 1.71% ← Current (declining trend accelerating)

---

### 3. Cost Per Click Increase - Efficiency Deterioration

**Insight:** CPC increased from $0.93 to $1.01 (+8%)

**What This Means:**
- Cost to acquire each click increased by $0.08
- Platform charging more for clicks as ad quality declines
- Relevance score deterioration evident

**Evidence:**
- CPM also increasing (+12%) while volume stable
- Quality scores declining on high-frequency audience segments
- Platform algorithm recognizing lower relevance

**Connection to ROAS Decline:**
- Lower CTR (fewer clicks)
- Higher CPC (more expensive per click)
- Combined effect: Significant ROAS pressure

---

### 4. Frequency vs. Impression Growth - Saturation Signal

**Key Finding:** Frequency up 35% while impressions up only 12%

**What This Means:**
- Platform running out of new users to show ads to
- Recycling ads to existing audience members
- Audience saturation approaching or present

**The Math:**
```
If impressions up 12% but frequency up 35%:
→ Available audience pool shrinking
→ Platform showing ads more times to fewer people
→ Classic saturation pattern
```

**Consequence:**
- Repeated ad exposure causes fatigue
- Audience becomes skeptical/ignores ads
- Lower CTR and conversion rates result

---

## Hypotheses & Root Cause Validation

### Hypothesis 1: Creative Fatigue (Confidence: 82%)

**Statement:** Extended exposure to the same creative variants is reducing engagement and conversion rates.

**Supporting Evidence:**
1. **Frequency Pattern:** CTR down 18.5% while frequency UP 35% = classic fatigue
2. **Creative Age:** Same variants for 60+ days without rotation
3. **Segment Concentration:** Decline concentrated in high-frequency users
4. **New Audience Test:** New audiences showing stable 2.1% CTR = creatives work
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Creative age correlates -0.79 with CTR

**Probability:** 82% confidence (strong evidence, some assumptions)

**Recommended Test:**
- Rotate new creative variants
- Expected improvement: 12-18% CTR, 8-15% ROAS
- Duration: 7 days
- Decision: If new creative achieves 1.9%+ CTR, scale to 60% of budget

---

### Hypothesis 2: Audience Saturation (Confidence: 75%)

**Statement:** Available audience approaching saturation, reducing reach quality.

**Supporting Evidence:**
1. **Frequency vs. Impressions Gap:** 35% frequency growth vs. 12% impression growth
2. **Rising Costs:** CPM up 12% despite stable volume
3. **Quality Score Decline:** Platform detecting relevance issues
4. **User Distribution Shift:** Conversions shifting to lower-intent segments

**Probability:** 75% confidence (clear pattern, requires validation)

**Recommended Test:**
- Expand audience segments (lookalike, interest-based)
- Expected improvement: 5-10% impressions, 3-7% CTR
- Duration: 14 days
- Decision: If new segments show >1.9% CTR, add to campaign mix
